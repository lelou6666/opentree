# NOTE that a bare-bones parametric router is required here, since we've switched
# to parametric routing for opentree and the two can't be mixed. The change
# was required to support hyphens in proper URLs!
#
# All the important stuff is in the app's router (opentree/webapp/routes.py).
# This is just enough to trigger parametric (vs. pattern-based) routing
# throughout the site.
